    Y "It's cute"
    "You say with a big bright smile"
    S "You really like it?"
    Y "Yeah"
    "Shrek squeals with excitement and he traps you in a big bear hug"
    S "Oh wait, sorry. I just got really happy for a second"
    "He says then awkwardly pulls away from you"
    Y "N-no it's okay you're a great hugger. You're so strong"
    "You slide yourself into his still open arms, and he embraces you. You bury your face in his chest, and you can hear his heart beating quickly. After a little while, you glance up at him, and he’s blushing. The two of you lock eyes, and he slowly begins to lean in towards you."

    "Shocked, you both jump away from each other and look outside. It has begun to pour."
    Y "Oh no! I’m gonna get soaked!"
    "You say with fear, you can't stand getting wet"
    S "You could stay here until it passes"
    "He says with a slight joy in his voice"
    Y "I would love to, but I really have to get back"
    "You say with a hint of sadness in your voice as he walks up to you and hugs you"
    S "Well, ok, but be safe, ok?"
    "You quietly nod and turn towards the door. You smile at him one last time before you leave. He looks like he wants to say something, but you’ll see him soon."
    "The next day you jollily hum the tune “All Star” by Smash Mouth during your route. What has gotten into you? You’re never this happy ever about doing your job. It’s too much work for too little pay, you get exactly 40 hours paid sick leave, your boss is a jerk, and you could go on and on for hours about Janelle and her warming fish in the microwave. Like c’mon, Janelle, you’ve been trying to stick to these stupid fad diets for years now, and you haven’t lost and ounce. I know you don’t have any medical issues, you told me, so just please for the love of god eat chicken like the rest of us. It costs nothing, it doesn’t stink, and it’s easier to prepare than your Atlantic cod."
    "Eventually, you arrive at the end of your route again: right in front of Shrek’s apartment complex. You walk inside, and he's waiting by the mailboxes for you, smiling."
    S "Hey stranger!"
    "You giggle and blush. Just the sight of him standing there, a peak male specimen, makes your face hot. As you quickly sort the mail, he continues talking to you."
    "After some top-tier banter, he invites you upstairs again."
    Y "I have to return my mail bag remeber"
    S "Oh yeah..."
    "He seems to scratch the back of his neck, but before you leave he grabs your arm"
    S "Well what if instead of returning the mail bag….You stay with me for a bit? You see, I saw how much you loved my donkey costume yesterday. So I bought you a dragon costume!"
    "You hesitate, but seeing how happy he is to have gotten you something so great, you can't help, but stay!"
    Y "Oh well okay! I can't say no to you after all!"
    "You and Shrek Hang around for a bit heck he even puts his Donkey fur suit on, you of course put on the Dragon Fur suit"

Y "Th-thank you...for the best time of my life....I-I hope I'll get to see you....again....some...day....."
